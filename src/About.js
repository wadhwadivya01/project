          <p className='para'>I am a skilled frontend developer with a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree from Kurukshetra University. After completing my degree, I pursued additional training in Angular at Infosys, where I gained in-depth knowledge of how to use this technology to build complex applications. Later on, I worked on a project that required me to use React, which I quickly adapted to and mastered its syntax and workflow. My experience with both Angular and React has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of frontend development.</p>
          <p className='para'> For me, frontend development is more than just a job â€“ it's a true passion. I love exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and I'm committed to delivering work that reflects my passion for this field.</p>
